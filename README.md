## Description
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate many biological processes and have been implicated in development and disease pathogenesis. The exact function for the large majority of lncRNAs is still unknown. To address whether lncRNAs could play a role in cell division, we combined a microscopy-based high-content RNAi screen with dedicated image analysis workflows to identify lncRNAs that regulate mitotic progression, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. By targeting over 2000 lncRNAs in HeLa cells, we discovered an assortment of new lncRNAs with unexplored functions in maintenance of genome stability.
